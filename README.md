Problem Statement: 
An education department in the US needs to analyse the factors that influence the admission of a student into a college. 
Analyse the historical data and determine the key drivers. 

Analysis information: 

Predictive 

• Run logistic model to determine the factors that influence the admission process of a student (Drop insignificant variables) 
• Transform variables to factors wherever required 
• Calculate accuracy of the model 
• Try other modeling techniques like decision tree and SVM and select a champion model 
• Determine the accuracy rates for each model 
• Select the most accurate model 
• Identify other Machine learning or statistical techniques that can be used 

Descriptive 

• Categorize the grade point average into High, Medium, and Low (with admission probability percentages) and plot it on a point chart. 
• Cross grid for admission variables with GRE Categorization is shown below: 


GRE 	Categorized 
0-440 	Low 
440-580 	Medium 
580 + 	High
